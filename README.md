**Telecome Customer Churn Analyais**

The goal of this project is to understand why customers are leaving (churning) and uncover the key factors driving this behavior.
Using a telecom dataset of over 77,000 customer records, I performed data cleaning and transformation in MySQL, 
and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize churn patterns.
The analysis helps identify which customer segments are most at risk and provides data-driven suggestions to improve retention and reduce churn.

**Data Cleaning Using Mysql**
Performed data type conversions (e.g., converting dates and numerical fields into proper formats).
Identified and handled missing or null values by replacing them with suitable alternatives or defaults.
Ensured data consistency and accuracy across all columns before loading into Power BI for visualization

**Key Insights**

Total Customers: 6,418
Total Joined: 411
Total Churn: 1,732
Churn Rate: 27.0%
Retention Rate: 66.6%

**High-Risk Customer Segments** 

**Contract Type** →
Month-to-Month customers have the highest churn rate (46.5%) — this group is most at risk because they can easily cancel without long-term commitment.
**Age Group** →
Customers aged above 60 show the highest churn (36.9%).
Younger groups (<20, 20–50) show moderate churn (~22–25%).
**Internet Type** →
Fiber Optic users have the highest churn (41.1%), suggesting possible dissatisfaction with service quality or pricing.
**Payment Method** →
Mailed Check users churn the most (37.8%), possibly due to inconvenience compared to online payments.
**State** →
Jammu & Kashmir (57.2%), Assam (38.1%), and Jharkhand (34.5%) show higher churn rates than other regions.
Category of Churn Reason →
Competitor-related churn is the leading cause (761 customers), followed by attitude and dissatisfaction issues.


**Result**
Delivered a comprehensive churn analysis highlighting key risk factors and customer retention opportunities, supporting data-driven decision-making in the telecom industry.
